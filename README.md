> **One API for public web & social data — plus a Tavily-style research agent that turns questions into cited answers.**

Ask a question → the agent searches the web and social platforms, scrapes what matters, and returns a markdown answer with `[n]` citations. Or hit the platforms directly: **Twitter/X, Reddit, YouTube, Bluesky, Hacker News, Mastodon, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook** — all keyless, all through one unified endpoint.

The pain this solves: getting public web + social data normally means juggling 6 paid scraper APIs, half-dead libraries, and brittle scripts. ScrapeX is one self-hosted API with **honest status reporting** — when a platform blocks anonymous access, you get `status: "blocked"` and an explanation, never fabricated data.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hemoyt/ScrapeX.git && cd ScrapeX
docker compose up -d
# Web UI at http://localhost:8000 — API docs at /docs
```

**Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser** — ScrapeX ships with a built-in UI (no build step, no Node):

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/store.png" alt="ScrapeX Scraper Store — Profile Finder searching one username across every platform" width="920">
</p>

- **Store** — an actor-store-style gallery: one card per platform, pick profile/posts/search, run it or start a full dataset run with CSV export. The Profile Finder sits on top.
- **Competitors** — type your product, AI discovers the competitors and pulls their social profiles + what Reddit/HN are saying about them. Plus a "track mentions" search across platforms.
- **Research** — ask a question, get a cited answer with sources and the agent's full tool trace.
- **Playground** — try every API endpoint with editable request bodies and pretty JSON.

```bash
# Ask the research agent (needs a free OpenRouter key for answers)
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/agent \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query": "What are developers saying about AI agents this week?"}'

# Scrape a YouTube channel — no API key
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/social/youtube \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query_type": "posts", "identifier": "@mkbhd", "limit": 5}'

# One keyword, five platforms, one call
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/social/search \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query": "open source llm", "platforms": ["reddit", "hackernews", "bluesky", "youtube"]}'
```

---

## 🤖 The Research Agent

`POST /api/v1/agent` — the Tavily-style core. The LLM runs a tool loop over ScrapeX's own capabilities (`web_search`, `scrape_url`, `social_search`, `social_posts`), registers every result as a numbered source, and answers with citations that map to real URLs.

```json
{
  "query": "Is the Rust vs Go debate still active?",
  "depth": "advanced",          // "basic" = 3 steps, "advanced" = 8
  "max_sources": 8,
  "include_social": true
}
```

Returns `{answer, sources[], steps[], usage, status}`. The `steps` array is a full trace of what the agent did. Without an OpenRouter key it degrades to search-only (`status: "no_llm"`) instead of failing.

`POST /api/v1/search` also accepts `"include_answer": true` for a one-shot cited answer over web results — the lightweight version of the agent.

---

## 🖥️ Deploy on your own VPS

**Coolify** (or any Nixpacks platform like Railway):

1. New Resource → **Public Repository** → paste `https://github.com/hemoyt/ScrapeX`
2. **Build Pack:** pick **Dockerfile** (recommended — includes the Playwright browser for JS rendering & the TikTok fallback). Nixpacks also works now: the repo ships a `Procfile` + `nixpacks.toml` with the right start command.
3. **Ports Exposes:** set to **`8000`** — this is the step everyone misses. ScrapeX listens on 8000; if the proxy points at the default 3000 you'll get Traefik's `404 page not found` even though the deploy says Finished.
4. Deploy, then open the domain → the web UI is at `/`, docs at `/docs`, health at `/health`.

Set your env vars (`SCRAPEX_AI_PROVIDER`, `SCRAPEX_AI_API_KEY`, `SCRAPEX_API_KEYS`…) in the platform's Environment tab. If you're exposing the API publicly, set `SCRAPEX_API_KEYS` so auth is enforced.

**Plain Docker on any VPS:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hemoyt/ScrapeX.git && cd ScrapeX
docker compose up -d          # listens on :8000
```

## 📦 Runs & Datasets — get ALL the data (Apify-style)

The sync `/social` endpoints are built for speed: one page, `limit ≤ 50`, one HTTP request. That's the wrong shape when you want *everything* — a full subreddit listing, 500 HN hits, a whole Bluesky feed. **Runs** fix the limited-time problem the same way Apify does:

1. `POST /api/v1/runs` starts a **background job** — your HTTP request returns immediately, so the scrape is no longer limited by request timeouts.
2. The run **paginates the platform with real cursors** (Reddit `after=`, HN Algolia pages, Bluesky cursors, Mastodon `max_id`) until it has `max_items`, the platform runs out, or the time budget (`SCRAPEX_RUN_TIME_BUDGET`, default 240s) is spent.
3. Every item lands in a **dataset** you can page through and export as **JSON, NDJSON, or CSV**.

```bash
# 1. Start a run — up to 500 items instead of the sync cap of 50
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/runs -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"platform": "hackernews", "query_type": "search", "identifier": "llm agents", "max_items": 500}'
# -> {"id": "6c883f636117", "dataset_id": "083f07a8eb4f", "status": "READY", ...}

# 2. Poll until SUCCEEDED (also: TIMED_OUT keeps partial data, FAILED explains why)
curl localhost:8000/api/v1/runs/6c883f636117

# 3. Export the dataset — pick your format
curl "localhost:8000/api/v1/datasets/083f07a8eb4f/items?offset=0&limit=100"   # JSON envelope
curl "localhost:8000/api/v1/datasets/083f07a8eb4f/items?format=ndjson"        # 1 item per line
curl "localhost:8000/api/v1/datasets/083f07a8eb4f/items?format=csv" -o out.csv
```

How a run flows through the system:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client / SDK
    participant A as ScrapeX API
    participant W as Run worker
    participant P as Platform (reddit, hn, bluesky, mastodon, ...)
    C->>A: POST /api/v1/runs (max_items=500)
    A-->>C: 202 run_id + dataset_id (instantly)
    loop until max_items, no cursor left, or time budget spent
        W->>P: fetch_page(cursor)
        P-->>W: page of posts + next cursor
        W->>W: dedupe, push into dataset
    end
    C->>A: GET /runs/id (poll)
    A-->>C: SUCCEEDED, item_count=500
    C->>A: GET /datasets/id/items?format=csv
    A-->>C: full dataset export
```

Run lifecycle — every terminal state keeps whatever data was already collected:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> READY: POST /runs
    READY --> RUNNING: worker starts
    RUNNING --> SUCCEEDED: max_items reached or platform exhausted
    RUNNING --> TIMED_OUT: time budget spent (partial data kept)
    RUNNING --> ABORTED: POST /runs/id/abort
    RUNNING --> FAILED: first page errored (honest error message)
    SUCCEEDED --> [*]
    TIMED_OUT --> [*]
    ABORTED --> [*]
    FAILED --> [*]
```

Cursor pagination is implemented natively for **Reddit, Hacker News, Bluesky, and Mastodon** today; other platforms serve a single (still deduped) page per run. Verified live: 150 HN items in 5.2s, 120 Reddit posts in 5.7s, 120 Bluesky posts in 3.7s, 90 Mastodon statuses in 7.2s — all past the old 50-item ceiling.

## 🏪 Scraper Store & Profile Finder

Open **http://localhost:8000 → Store**: an Apify-store-style gallery, but built in, self-hosted, and free. One card per platform showing exactly what it can do (reliability badges come live from `/health`). Pick **profile / posts / post / search**, drop in a username or query, and either:

- **Run** — instant result in the card (profile stats, latest posts, raw JSON), or
- **Full run → dataset** — a background run with cursor pagination (up to 200 items from the UI) and one-click **CSV / NDJSON / JSON** download when it finishes.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/store_run.png" alt="A Store card after a full dataset run — 200 items in 4 pages with CSV / NDJSON / JSON export" width="420">
</p>

At the top of the Store sits the **Profile Finder** — type just a username and ScrapeX checks **every profile-capable platform concurrently** and tells you where that handle exists and what its public profile says:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/profiles/find \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username": "mkbhd"}'
# -> {"found": ["bluesky", "instagram", "tiktok", "twitter", "youtube"],
#     "checked": [... 9 platforms ...],
#     "results": {"youtube": {"profile": {"followers": 19900000, ...}}, ...}}
```

Scope it with `"platforms": ["twitter", "youtube"]` to check only what you care about. Platforms that block anonymous lookups (LinkedIn, Facebook) are reported honestly in `results` rather than silently dropped.

## 🧠 Bring Your Own AI

Every AI feature (research agent, competitor discovery, `/extract`, search answers, AI Studio, AI-clean summaries) runs on **whatever LLM you plug in** — cloud or fully local.

**Easiest: set it in the app.** Open the web UI → **Settings** tab, pick a provider, paste your API key, pick a model from the dropdown, Save. No env vars, no restart, no guessing a model ID — every provider ships a curated, up-to-date list of models to choose from (with a "Custom model ID…" escape hatch for anything not listed). It takes effect immediately and persists on the server.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/settings.png" alt="ScrapeX Settings tab — pick an AI provider and paste your API key right in the app, no restart" width="820">
</p>

Prefer env vars? Those still work too:

```bash
SCRAPEX_AI_PROVIDER=anthropic
SCRAPEX_AI_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

(A key set in the Settings tab overrides the env var; "Reset to env" in the tab drops it again.)

| Provider | `SCRAPEX_AI_PROVIDER` | Key needed | Default `SCRAPEX_AI_MODEL` |
|---|---|:--:|---|
| OpenRouter (default) | `openrouter` | ✅ | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` |
| Anthropic | `anthropic` | ✅ | `claude-sonnet-5` |
| OpenAI | `openai` | ✅ | `gpt-5.4-mini` |
| DeepSeek | `deepseek` | ✅ | `deepseek-v4-flash` |
| xAI / Grok | `xai` or `grok` | ✅ | `grok-4.3` |
| Groq | `groq` | ✅ | `openai/gpt-oss-20b` |
| Mistral | `mistral` | ✅ | `mistral-large-latest` |
| **Ollama (local, free)** | `ollama` | ❌ | `llama3.1:8b` |
| **LM Studio (local, free)** | `lmstudio` | ❌ | whatever you loaded |
| Anything else (vLLM, llama.cpp, LiteLLM…) | `custom` + `SCRAPEX_AI_BASE_URL` | optional | your model id |

They all speak the OpenAI chat-completions dialect, so one client covers every row. `GET /health` shows which brain is currently plugged in (`"ai": {"provider": ..., "model": ..., "enabled": ...}`) — the web UI displays it in the header. The old `SCRAPEX_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` still works unchanged. `GET /api/v1/settings/ai` also returns each provider's curated model list under `providers.<name>.models` — that's what powers the Settings dropdown, and it's just as usable from a script.

### AI Studio — confirm it's actually working

Open the web UI → **AI Studio** tab (or `POST /api/v1/ai/studio`) to send one prompt straight to your configured provider — no tools, no agent loop, just a direct round trip. It's the fastest way to confirm a provider/API key/model combination actually works before pointing the research agent or competitor discovery at it, and to try a model from the picker before committing to it in Settings.

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/ai/studio \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt": "Say hello in one sentence.", "temperature": 0.7}'
```

### Clean output — pass results through the AI before they come out

Add `"clean": true` to any `/social/{platform}` call, `/social/search`, or a dataset run and the output goes through a two-stage pipeline before it reaches you:

1. **Tidy (always, no AI needed)** — leftover HTML stripped, whitespace collapsed, runaway text capped, empty fields and the noisy raw `data[]` payloads dropped. What's left is just readable posts and profiles.
2. **AI pass (when a provider is configured)** — the tidied content is summarized into a plain-language `summary`: 3–5 bullets of what the posts are saying, a 2-sentence profile description, or an overview of a whole dataset run. In `/social/search` you get **one summary across all platforms**.

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/social/reddit \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query_type": "posts", "identifier": "python", "limit": 10, "clean": true}'
# -> posts are tidy, data[] is empty, and "summary" reads like a human wrote it
```

No provider configured? `clean` still tidies everything — `summary` is simply `null`. A failed summary never breaks a scrape. In the Store, every card has an **AI clean** toggle that does the same thing.

### What computer can run it?

ScrapeX itself is featherweight — the heavy question is only the **local** LLM, if you choose one:

| What you run | CPU | RAM | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ScrapeX API alone (cloud or no AI) | 1 vCPU | **512 MB – 1 GB** | Runs on a $5 VPS or Raspberry Pi 4 |
| + Playwright (JS rendering, TikTok fallback) | 2 vCPU | **+1 GB** | Headless Chromium is the hungry part |
| + Ollama `llama3.2:3b` | 4 cores | **8 GB** | Any modern laptop; fine for extraction/answers |
| + Ollama `llama3.1:8b` / `qwen2.5:7b` | 4–8 cores | **16 GB** | Sweet spot — good agent tool-calling; M1/M2 Mac or mid PC |
| + Ollama `qwen2.5:14b` | 8 cores | **32 GB** | Noticeably better reasoning |
| + Ollama `llama3.3:70b` | 16 cores / GPU | **64 GB+** (or 2×24 GB GPU) | Server class; near-cloud quality |

Rule of thumb: a Q4-quantized model needs roughly **RAM ≈ parameters × 0.75 GB** plus headroom — and models at 7B+ handle the agent's tool-calling loop much more reliably than 3B ones.

## 📱 Social Platform Support (honest matrix)

Every platform speaks the same request shape via `POST /api/v1/social/{platform}`:

```json
{"query_type": "profile | posts | post | search", "identifier": "...", "limit": 10, "options": {}}
```

| Platform | profile | posts | post | search | Strategy (all keyless) |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|---|
| **Bluesky** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Official public AppView API |
| **Hacker News** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ + comments | ✅ | Official Algolia API |
| **YouTube** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Innertube (YouTube's own JSON API) |
| **Reddit** | — | ✅ | ✅ + comments | ✅ | old.reddit.com HTML |
| **Mastodon** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | Instance REST API; search auth-gated on big instances → hashtag fallback |
| **Twitter/X** | ✅ | 🚫* | ✅ | 🚫* | fxtwitter → vxtwitter → syndication CDN chain |
| **Instagram** | 🟡 | 🟡 | 🟡 | — | web profile API + embed pages; rate-limits datacenter IPs |
| **TikTok** | 🟡 | 🟡† | 🟡 | — | embedded page JSON; Playwright fallback |
| **LinkedIn** | 🟡 | — | — | — | og:/meta salvage; login wall reported honestly |
| **Facebook** | 🟡 | — | — | — | og:/meta salvage; login wall reported honestly |

✅ reliable · 🟡 best-effort (may return `status: "partial"` or `"blocked"` with an explanation) · — unsupported (the API tells you)
\* Twitter timelines/search have no reliable keyless source since Nitter died; single tweets & profiles work great. Point `SCRAPEX_NITTER_INSTANCES` at a live mirror to re-enable them.
† TikTok video lists need JS hydration — works where Playwright can run.

Every response includes `status` (`ok | partial | blocked | error`), `source` (which strategy served it), normalized `posts[]`/`profile`, and the raw payload in `data[]`. Check `GET /health` for the capability matrix, or `GET /health?probe=true` for **live** platform reachability from your server.

The same matrix as a picture — of the 40 platform × endpoint combinations, half are fully reliable and only 2 are hard-blocked (Twitter timelines/search, until you point `SCRAPEX_NITTER_INSTANCES` at a live mirror):

```mermaid
pie showData
    title Endpoint reliability across 10 platforms (40 combinations)
    "Reliable" : 20
    "Best-effort" : 9
    "Blocked (keyless)" : 2
    "Not offered" : 9
```

## 🧪 Development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest -q                              # 112 tests, no network needed
python scripts/verify_platforms.py    # live smoke test from YOUR egress IP
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

CI runs the test suite on every push/PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). The live verify script matters because scraping reliability depends on your server's IP reputation — run it after deploying.

### A note on honesty

Platforms fight scrapers. Anything marked 🟡 can break or get rate-limited without notice — when that happens ScrapeX tells you (`status`, `error`) rather than returning stale or fake data. Responses are cached (default 5 min) to keep your footprint small. Scrape responsibly and respect each platform's terms.
